# 📦 CSV Splitter & Email Enhancer

🚀 A simple tool to **split large CSV files** and **analyze email data** (like phishing detection) — all with a user-friendly GUI.

## 🧠 Why I Made This

I couldn’t find any easy tool that could split CSV files and analyze email content for security, so I built my own.

- Built for Windows
- Created by **Faizan Shakir**
- GUI powered with Python & Tkinter

- 🔹 **CSV Splitter** – Break down large CSVs into smaller files
- 🔹 **Email Enhancer** – Extract sender, links, IPs from CSV email logs
